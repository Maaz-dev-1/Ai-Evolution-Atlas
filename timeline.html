                    <h3>Dartmouth Conference</h3>
                    <p>In the summer of 1956, a small group of visionary researchers gathered at Dartmouth College, led by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon. This “Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence” proposed that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” This conference did not yield immediate breakthroughs, but it seeded a field, aligning scattered ideas under a unified name—Artificial Intelligence—and inspired an entire generation of computer scientists to believe machines could someday think, learn, and reason, setting the intellectual foundations for modern AI research.

                    <h3>Perceptron Introduced</h3>
                    <p>Frank Rosenblatt introduced the Perceptron, the first algorithmically described neural network capable of learning. Inspired by simplified models of biological neurons, the perceptron could adjust its weights to classify inputs into categories, effectively allowing it to “learn” from data. Though limited to linearly separable problems, its introduction led to immense optimism about machine learning and sparked funding in neural network research. The perceptron’s limitations, later pointed out by Minsky and Papert in 1969, caused a temporary “AI winter” for neural networks, but its principles laid the groundwork for modern deep learning decades later.</p>

                    <p>At MIT, Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, a simple yet groundbreaking chatbot that could simulate a conversation using pattern matching and substitution. One of its famous scripts, DOCTOR, mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist by reflecting user statements back as questions. Although ELIZA did not “understand” language, it demonstrated how simple rule-based systems could simulate human-like conversation and laid the groundwork for the evolution of natural language processing and conversational agents like Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT.</p>

                    <p>At Stanford, Edward Feigenbaum, Bruce Buchanan, and Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg initiated the Dendral Project, an AI system that could interpret mass spectrometry data to deduce molecular structures. Dendral marked a pivotal shift by focusing on expert-level knowledge in a specific domain, establishing the expert systems paradigm in AI. It proved that with sufficient domain-specific knowledge and reasoning mechanisms, computers could assist scientists in complex tasks, foreshadowing today’s AI-powered scientific discovery.</p>
